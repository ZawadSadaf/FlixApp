### Notes
My Pod Install did not work if I had more time to figure that out then I defintely would have done. I had to finish the project last minute becaue I did not have access to a MacOS because the previous MacOS I had access to was from a friend of mine who sold it so I had to buy a MacBook (I was planning on buying one anyway, just not this early) so I basically had to do the entire assignment today. I hope to figure out the issue with pod install since that will probably halt me in future projects
